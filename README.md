# Asynchronous Deep ReinFlappybird

This repo contains a modified version of an [Asynchronous Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/miyosuda/async_deep_reinforce) implementation by [@miyosuda](https://github.com/miyosuda), and a slightly edited version of [Flappybird](https://github.com/yenchenlin/DeepLearningFlappyBird) by [@yenchenlin](https://github.com/yenchenlin).

More info later!

## Getting started
